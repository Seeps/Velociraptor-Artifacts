name: Windows.Registry.TaskCache
description: |
    This artifact enumerates cached scheduled tasks and helps identify malicious persistence
    within the 'TaskCache' key - namely the 'Tasks' and 'Tree' subkeys:

     - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tasks
     - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree

    The 'Actions' value will list the file or embedded command of interest. For example, crypto malware such as
    LemonDuck utilizes Base64 encoded PowerShell commands. 
    
    The 'Path' value helps identify the name of the scheduled task and its location within the Tasks folder on the filesystem.
    
    The 'Id' value is a GUID that is used to tie the 'Tasks' and 'Tree' entries for a specific task.
